        <h2>Questions about Ruby on Rails</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Please include the defintion of each part of your solution stack.</strong></p>
        Ruby on Rails is a solution stack where the name of the stack isn't an acronym for the languages it contains! Ruby on Rails, commmonly referred
        to as Rails, is a framework in itself for web development. Ruby is a separate language that the framework was built on. Ruby has been around since
        the 1990s and is a high level interpreted language meant to serve as an "object oriented scripting langauge" as the creator Yukihiro Matsumoto puts it.
        Ruby was then used to create the server side web application framework Rails which helped in the development of many current websites. Along with Ruby,
        HTML/CSS/JS is also used in the Rails framework to provide for the front-end of development. Ruby on Rails is what is known as a model-view-controller 
        framework, or MVC, where a default structure is provided for databases, web services, and web pages. The model is represented with ActiveRecord and deals
        mainly with the database side of Rails. The view is represented by ActionView and uses HTML and Ruby to display the front end of the webpage. The controller
        is ActionController and deals with communication between the database (model) and view as well as web requests. All this enables Rails developers to rapidly 
        develop web apps.
        <br>
        <p><strong>2.  Why or in what situation is this solution important</strong></p>
        Ruby on Rails is great for rapid creation, development, and release of a web application. Rails is perfect for start-ups or smaller companies that
        simply want to get a good website up on the web as fast as possible. Other stacks would take a considerable amount of time to develop and validate
        a web app while Rails could get it done over one weekend. Ruby on Rails' philosphy of <em>Convention over Configuration</em> also allows its developers to not
        have to worry about configurating what files to set up and instead focus on conventions that allows a robust website to be built quickly. To sum it up,
        Ruby on Rails is the perfect solution stack for developers that want to rapidly build a web app in the easiest and most time efficient way possible. 
        <br>
        <p><strong>3.  Are the components open source (free) or is there a cost involved.</strong></p>
        You would think a quick and easy solution like Rails might come at a high cost, but that is in fact the opposite. Ruby on Rails is 100% free and open source software.
        This means that not only can you use it whenever you want, but you can also contribute to making Rails a better framework as well. 
        <br>
        <p><strong>4.  List 2 companies that use your stack (provide links to their websites)</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Airbnb (<a href = "https://www.airbnb.com/" target ="_blank">airbnb.com</a>)</li>
            <li>Github (<a href = "https://www.github.com/" target ="_blank">github.com</a>)</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>5.  How hard is it (according to available information online) to become proffiecient in the use of your stack ?</strong></p>
        In order to become proffiecient in Ruby on Rails, you have to learn HTML/CSS/JS and Ruby. All four of those languages in themselves aren't very hard to learn,
        and since Rails is the framework built from Ruby, if you know Ruby, you can move into Rails a bit easier. How long it takes to learn all this depends, though.
        There seems to be a divide online between how long it takes to learn and develop something with Rails. Some say it took them two years to build something
        decent, but the learning process wasn't necessarily difficult. Others note that Ruby is a good introductory language to programming and that many can gravitate and 
        learn Rails relatively easy and quickly. Overall, no one said Rails itself was hard to learn though. Rails seems to be very forgiving to those who haven't programmed
        much and is easy to use. Therefore, it doesn't seem too difficult to become proffiecient in Ruby on Rails.
